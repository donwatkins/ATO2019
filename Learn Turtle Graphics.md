Learn Turtle Graphics
Learn the basics of Python Turtle Graphics
Don Watkins
OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
The student will learn to install Python Idle3 and perform a ‘pip3’ install of Mu-Editor. The student will use Mu-Editor and Python code to create simple turtle graphics within the coding platform. 
EDUCATION STANDARDS
    1. ISTE Learning Standard - 5a - Students formulate problem definitions suited for technology-assisted methods such as data analysis, abstract models and algorithmic thinking in exploring and finding solutions.

OBJECTIVES
    1. Students will learn how to install Python 3 Idle programming environment and to install the Mu-Editor from the terminal.
    2. Students will learn how to launch the Mu-Editor
    3. Students will learn how to load the ‘turtle library’ and write simple programming statements to move the turtle around the display. 
MATERIALS NEEDED
    1. Linux Laptop
    2. Python 3, IDLE and Mu-Editor installed
    3. Access to the Internet


Instructions
    1. Install Python 3 and IDLE: 
        a. On Ubuntu the install is: $ sudo apt install idle3
        b. On Fedora the install is: $ sudo dnf install python-tools
    2. After installing Python 3 and IDLE you will need to install Mu-Editor. This installation is completed in a terminal by entering the following command:
        a. $ pip3 install mu-editor
    3. Launch Mu-editor by opening terminal and entering the following $ mu-editor

    4. Select Python 3 and then click ‘OK’.  Then click on the “+” below to begin a new program.  



    5. Then enter your first program as shown above.
    6. Save the program by clicking on the ‘Save’ (Third button from the left)
    7. ‘Run’ the program. 
    8. What happened? You should see a square drawn by the turtle. 
    9. You can make changes to this program by adding more ‘turtle’ steps you can add more sides by decreasing the angle and adding more lines. 
    10. An easy way to increase the complexity is by using a ‘for’ loop. 

    11. Select ‘Save’ and then ‘Run’. What happened?
